# typst.nvim
WIP. Goals: Tree-sitter highlighting, snippets, and a smooth integration with neovim.


Language spec(?):
https://github.com/typst/typst/blob/main/tools/support/typst.tmLanguage.json

This plugin will take much inspiration from VimTeX and silicon.nvim :)


Note: since the language I'm most familiar with is rust, this project will probably be written in Rust.
