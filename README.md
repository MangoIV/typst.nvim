# typst.nvim
WIP. Goals: Treesitter highlighting, snippets, and a smooth intergration with neovim.


Language spec(?):
https://github.com/typst/typst/blob/main/tools/support/typst.tmLanguage.json

This plugin will take much inspiration from VimTeX :)


Note: since the language I'm most familar with is rust, this project will probably be written in Rust.
